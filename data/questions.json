    {"question": "There are two types of explosives, mixtures and compounds. A mixture is a combination of an oxidizer and a fuel. The oxidizer helps release the energy from the fuel by adding oxygen molecules to the fuel. A compound is a substance that by itself is explosive and there is no need for an oxidizer. Which one out of the following explosives is a mixture of an oxidizer and a fuel?", "answers": ["Acetone peroxide", "Ammonal", "Dynamite", "TNT"], "correct": 1},

    {"question": "What does ANFO stand for?", "answers": ["Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil", "Anhydrous Nitrating and Formulating Oxidizer", "Anhydrous Nitrating Fuel Oil", "None of these"], "correct": 0},
    {"question": "What is a sensitiser?", "answers": ["A substance which makes something more stable so that its easier to work with", "A substance used to increase the instability of the explosive", "A weak explosive", "A powerful explosive"], "correct": 1},
    {"question": "There are two ways for an explosive to release its energy. The first way is detonation whereby the explosive force travels faster than 1000m/s. The second way is when an explosive releases its energy slower than 1000m/s. This is called: ?", "answers": ["Delocation", "Dedetonation", "Deflagration", "Depravation"], "correct": 2}
